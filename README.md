# Plinko

This source code includes the implementation of our project, named **Plinko**. The relevant file changed is prefetcher/plinko.llc_pref where we have implemented our prefetcher.
<br/>
The "analysis-2" branch contains a modified version of the original Bingo Prefetcher, reflected in "src/main.cc" and "prefetcher/bingo\_mod.llc\_pref". It also has a clone of a suffix tree python library in the "analysis" directory. A custom analysis script that we wrote is present in "analysis/scripts/footprint_alignments.py".
<br/>
To run the modified prefetcher, use the "master" branch. For pattern history table analysis of the Bingo prefetcher and/or for analysis scripts, use the "analysis-2" branch.
